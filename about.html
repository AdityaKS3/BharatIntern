                  <span style="font-size: xx-large;">" Hello</span> everyone, my name is <b>Aditya Kumar Singh</b>. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Application. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a keen interest in web development and helped in automating a college registration procedure. 
                  I have experience working with programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Java, and C. 
I am currently working on this project given by Bharat Internship, where I am developing a website that holds my personal and professional details and another task was to make a temperature converter(Have a look <a href=index2.html style="color:rgb(79, 55, 101)">click here</a>). This experience helped me gain valuable experience in learning about front-end and back-end.
In terms of achievements, I have completed several online courses at PROGRAMMING HUB,for the same languages mentioned. I have also received a certificate of completion for a course on DSA Using JAVA from NPTEL(Swayam).
<br><br>
Talking about my other creative side, I have experience in graphic design, illustration, and 2D animation, sketching, making digital stickers, and creating cartoon characters. 
I find joy in bringing characters to life through animation and creating visually appealing illustrations.
Apart from my academic pursuits, I am also passionate about dancing and sculpture. I enjoy expressing myself through movement and exploring different dance styles. 
I have also dabbled in sculpture, where I have experimented with different materials and techniques to create three-dimensional art pieces.
I am excited to be a part of this master's program, as it will provide me with the opportunity to further enhance my knowledge and skills in the field of computer science. I look forward to learning from my professors and collaborating with my fellow students.

<br><br>If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me. <br> <span style="font-size: xx-large;">Thank you!"</span>
